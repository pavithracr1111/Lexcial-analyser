PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT

The main purpose/goal of the project is to take in a c file, .c, and produce the sequence of
tokens that can be used for the next stage in compilation.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

Lexical Analyzer will be a small product demonstrating the use of C language. It will
assume the source program stores in a file which will be accessed using the file operations and also
assuming that the input is taken from the output of the preprocessor. It is designed only for the C
language, not for any other language. It will not be using any optimal data structures or algorithms
in the initial versions.
